# Perspective API Quickstart

1.  **Get whitelisted.** To use the API, your you need to have your email
    address whitelisted. [Apply here](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/). You'll
    hear from someone on our team once you're approved.

2.  **Create a Google Cloud project.** Go to the [Google Cloud
    console](https://console.developers.google.com/) to create a new project.
    You can also use an existing project, if you have one.

    *Note*: Your application doesn't need to be *hosted* on Google Cloud, but
    you will still need a Google Cloud project to authenticate your API
    requests.

3.  **Enable the API.** Once you've been whitelisted, you'll be able to enable
    the API for your project. Go to the [Perspective API's overview
    page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/overview)
    and click **_Enable_**. If you haven't yet been whitelisted, you'll get a
    permissions error at this point.
    
4.  **Generate an API key.** To authenticate your requests, you'll need to
    generate credentials for your project. Using an API key is the simplest
    option. Go to the [API credentials
    page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), click
    **_Create credentials_**, and choose "API Key".
    
    Note that it typically takes only a few minutes for a new API key to 
    have access after the API is enabled, but it can on occasion 
    take up to an hour; until the API key is enabled, you may get errors of
    the form "API Key not found. Please pass a valid API key".

5.  **Make an AnalyzeComment request.**

    Use the API key you generated in the previous step as the `key` param in
    this curl command:

    ```shell
    $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data \
        '{comment: {text: "what kind of idiot name is foo?"},
          languages: ["en"],
          requestedAttributes: {TOXICITY:{}} }' \
        https://commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/v1alpha1/comments:analyze?key=YOUR_KEY_HERE
    {
      "attributeScores": {
        "TOXICITY": {
          "summaryScore": {
            "value": 0.9014498,
            "type": "PROBABILITY"
          }
        }
      },
      "languages": [
        "en"
      ]
    }
    ```

    The curl command issued an API request to analyze the `comment.text` field
    for the `requestedAttributes`, in this case the `TOXICITY` model.

    In the response, the field `attributeScores.TOXICITY.summaryScore.value`
    gives the toxicity model's score for the comment. In this case, the comment
    got a 0.9 out of 1.0. A less mean-spirited comment should get a lower score.
    
See the [API reference documentation](api_reference.md) for details on all of
the request and response fields, as well as the available values for
`requestedAttributes`. There are quite a few
[experimental models](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi/blob/master/api_reference.md#models),
such as "obscene", "attack on a commenter", "spam", etc, that you may find
interesting.
